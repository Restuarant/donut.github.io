	<p style="padding: 30px"> A <b>doughnut or donut</b> is a type of food made from leavened fried dough. It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. Doughnut is the <b>traditional</b> spelling, while donut is the simplified version; the terms are often used interchangeably.<br>Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, but other types of batters can also be used. Various toppings and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include:
		<ul>
			<li>Water</li>

			<li>Sugar</li>
			<li>Egg</li>
			<li>Leavening</li>
			<li>Oil</li>

	<br><b>National Doughnut Day</b>, also known as <b>National Donut Day</b>, celebrated in the United States of America, is on the first Friday of June each year, succeeding the Doughnut Day event created by <b>"The Salvation Army"</b> in 1938 to honor those of their members who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I. About 250 Salvation Army volunteers went to France. Because of the difficulties of providing freshly baked goods from huts established in abandoned buildings near the front lines, the two Salvation Army volunteers (Ensign Margaret Sheldon and Adjutant Helen Purviance) came up with the idea of providing doughnuts. These are reported to have been an <b>"instant hit" and "soon many soldiers were visiting The Salvation Army huts"</b>. Margaret Sheldon wrote of one busy day: "Today I made 22 pies, 300 doughnuts, 700 cups of coffee." Soon, the women who did this work became known by the servicemen as <b>"Doughnut Dollies"</b>.</p>
